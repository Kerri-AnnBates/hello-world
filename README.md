Intro to learning about github

Hello everyone,

Kerri-ann here, I'm a student currrently interested in web development. I'm here as a student, to learn more of what it takes to become a good, no great web developer. I'm in school right now but I've been doing a lot of research on my own and learned that there's much more to becoming a successful developer than just getting a degree. Considering I'm completely new to this, I didn't know where else to start so I went to school to get the fundementals down on computers and programming. That's why I'm here. I hope to learn more about the world of developing on here as well.
